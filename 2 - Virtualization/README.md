Virtualization and Linux
====

In this lesson you will learn more about virtual machines (VMs). We touched on this a bit in [the first lesson](../Course Overview/README.md) but now you will learn how to host a VM on your own laptop.  

Begin by watching this [Virtualization Overview] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPUf4OC_ddg). 

Next follow up with this introduction to [Server Virtualization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHcvNxGfqfs). By the end of this video, you should be able to describe what a hypervisor does. Between the two videos, you should be able to list at least two advantages and at least one disadvantage of virtualization.

Then, watch [Vagrant Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlogPKBEuUM) and [Docker Overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGYAg7TMmp0).

Now, download and install the latest versions of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). (Make sure that VirtualBox has finished installing before you install Vagrant.) Also, download the latest .iso file of [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop).

In the next step, follow this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThsxqznrgCw) and create your own Ubuntu virtual machine in VirtualBox. Also, please follow [Linux for Data Science Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6YwPExkSESqcOfH8SP0vYRnavpJf-JRH) to learn the basics of using linux for our projects. You can also use the lecture file on Linux as a quick reference guide.
